# HINKAL WEBCLI: CURRENT STATE

This repository currently uses a Hinkal SDK integration in `src/webcli/app.ts` and `src/privacy/hinkalManager.ts`.
There is no active server CLI source under `src/servercli` right now.

# MAIN USER FLOW

1. `privacy-login` (or `privacy-import`) initializes private session.
2. `approve-token` approves public USDC to Hinkal spender.
3. `shield-token` moves public USDC to private spendable balance.
4. `private-supply` creates Aave position from private balance.
5. `show-positions` and `private-balance` inspect state.
6. `private-withdraw` withdraws position back to private balance.

# IDENTITY MODEL

1. EOA signer address: wallet account used for signatures and gas.
2. Private address: deterministic from mnemonic (used for `zkOwnerHash` derivation).
3. Hinkal sub-account: deterministic key (nonce 0) used by Hinkal action signing.

All three can differ. Do not assume they are equal.

# WITHDRAW BEHAVIOR (IMPORTANT)

1. Withdraw uses adapter `withdrawToRecipient(...)` with recipient set to Emporium.
2. Hinkal `recipientData` is provided so output returns to private balance.
3. For `max`, WebCLI resolves to exact position amount and retries with `amount - 1` on Aave rounding error (`0x47bc4b2c` / `NotEnoughAvailableUserBalance`).

# FEE MODEL + RESERVE GUARD

1. Hinkal fee is dynamic, relayer-estimated at runtime (`flatFee`).
2. WebCLI preflight estimates fee and applies reserve:
   - `reserve = flatFee + max(flatFee * bufferBps, minBuffer)`.
3. Default reserve config:
   - `bufferBps = 2000` (20%)
   - `minBuffer = 0.002 USDC`
4. User-visible fee lines are shown for supply and withdraw.
5. If insufficient private balance for amount + reserve, command fails early with clear error.

# CONFIG KEYS USED

1. `VITE_PRIVATE_RPC`
2. `VITE_PRIVATE_EMPORIUM`
3. `VITE_PRIVATE_SUPPLY_ADAPTER`
4. `VITE_SUPPLY_TOKEN`
5. `VITE_PRIVATE_DEBUG` (optional)
6. `VITE_PRIVATE_FEE_BUFFER_BPS` (optional)
7. `VITE_PRIVATE_FEE_BUFFER_MIN` (optional, USDC units)

# COMMON FAILURE MODES

1. `Insufficient funds` during private action:
   - usually private spendable cannot cover action amount + Hinkal fee reserve.
2. Adapter privacy executor mismatch:
   - adapter `privacyExecutor()` must equal configured Emporium.
3. `Transfer Failed`:
   - often allowance/routing mismatch in the specific adapter execution path.

# CHANGE SAFETY

1. Keep `private-supply` and `private-withdraw` semantics aligned with Hinkal demo SDK patterns.
2. Avoid custom runtime shims for SDK unless strictly necessary.
3. Validate changes with:
   - `bun run typecheck`
   - `bun run build:web`
