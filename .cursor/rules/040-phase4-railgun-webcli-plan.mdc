# PHASE 4 PLAN (HISTORICAL)

This phase originally outlined WebCLI orchestration for private supply/withdraw.
The current implementation is Hinkal-first and already exposes the canonical command surface.

## Current Canonical Commands

- `help`
- `clear`
- `login`
- `import <mnemonic>`
- `approve <amount>`
- `shield <amount>`
- `unshield <amount> [recipient]`
- `private-balance`
- `private-supply <amount>`
- `supply-positions`
- `private-withdraw <positionId> <amount|max>`

## Current Acceptance Expectations

1. User can run private supply end-to-end from WebCLI.
2. Position appears in adapter state.
3. Private withdraw returns output to private balance.
4. Position secret lifecycle is preserved (rotate/remove rules).
5. Validation passes via:
   - `bun run typecheck`
   - `bun run build:web`
