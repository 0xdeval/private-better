# PHASE 3 STATUS (HISTORICAL)

Phase 3 validated real Aave pool wiring and withdraw path correctness.

## What Stayed Relevant

1. Adapter supply/withdraw path contract invariants.
2. Position bookkeeping after withdraw.
3. Real Aave reserve compatibility checks.

## Current Canonical Env Keys

1. `PRIVATE_EMPORIUM`
2. `RPC_URL`
3. `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY`
4. `SUPPLY_TOKEN`
5. `AAVE_POOL`
6. `VAULT_FACTORY`
7. `PRIVATE_SUPPLY_ADAPTER`

## Exit Criteria Reference (historical)

1. Supply smoke on target chain.
2. Withdraw smoke with position updates.
3. Adapter/factory/pool/token wiring checks pass.
