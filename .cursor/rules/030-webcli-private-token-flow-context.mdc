# PRIVATE TOKEN FLOW

1. `approve <amount>` approves public token spend for Hinkal shield spender.
2. `shield <amount>` moves public USDC to private spendable balance.
3. `unshield <amount> [recipient]` moves private USDC back to public address.
4. `unshield-weth <amount> [recipient]` moves private WETH back to public address.
5. `private-balance [usdc|weth]` reads private spendable balance.

# CRITICAL NOTICES

1. Preserve token decimal-aware parsing/formatting.
2. Preserve signer/session checks before token operations.
3. Preserve explicit usage errors on missing/invalid args.
4. Keep recipient default behavior: connected EOA when recipient is omitted.

# TROUBLESHOOTING PATTERNS

1. Insufficient public allowance/balance impacts approve/shield path.
2. Insufficient private spendable balance impacts unshield path.
3. Wrong network causes failures before token actions.
